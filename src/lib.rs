//! ðŸ¦“ ðŸ”— ZebraChain: A futuristic cryptographic identity system.
//!
//! ZebraChain is a logged, quantum safe signing protocol designed to replace the long lived
//! asymmetric key pairs used to sign software releases (and to sign other super important stuff).
//!
//! ZebraChain uses the [NIST post quantum standard][nist.gov] algorithm [ML-DSA] (FIPS-204)
//! alongside [ed25519] in a hybrid signing construction (as recommended by the ML-DSA authors).
//!
//! This is a pre-release crate. The API is still being finalized. A quick-start will be added soon.
