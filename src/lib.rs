//! ðŸ¦“ ðŸ”— ZebraChain: A futuristic cryptographic identity system.
//!
//! ZebraChain is a logged, quantum safe signing protocol designed to replace the long lived
//! asymmetric key pairs used to sign software releases (and to sign other super important stuff).
//!
//! This is a pre-release crate. The API is still being finalized.
//!
//! # Quickstart
//!
//! ```
//! use tempfile;
//! use zf_zebrachain::{ChainStore, OwnedChainStore, Hash, Payload, generate_secret};
//!
//! // Chains are just files in a directory (for now). To get started you need a directory for
//! // your public chain files and a `ChainStore`:
//! let chain_dir = tempfile::TempDir::new().unwrap();
//! let store = ChainStore::new(chain_dir.path());
//!
//! // To create signatures in a chain that you own, you also need a directory for your secret
//! // chain files and secret key that will be used to encrypt them:
//! let secret_chain_dir = tempfile::TempDir::new().unwrap();
//! let storage_secret = generate_secret().unwrap(); // Uses getrandom::fill()
//! let mystore = OwnedChainStore::build(
//!     chain_dir.path(), secret_chain_dir.path(), storage_secret
//! );
//!
//! // A Payload is what you to sign. Currently it's a 64-bit timestamp and a 256-bit hash. To
//! // create a new chain, you need the first payload that you want to sign:
//! let p1 = Payload::new(123, Hash::from_bytes([42; 32]));
//!
//! // To create a new chain, you also need some initial entropy, which is used to derive the seeds
//! // for the 1st and 2nd ML-DSA/ed25519 hybrid keypairs.
//! let initial_entropy = generate_secret().unwrap();
//!
//! // Create a chain, the first block of which will contain the signed payload. The first block
//! // is signed with the 1st keypair, but the hash of the public key of the 2nd keypair is
//! // included in the 1st block. This is the forward contract for the keypair that will be used
//! // to sign the next block.
//! let mut mychain = mystore.create_chain(&initial_entropy, &p1).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(mychain.tail().payload, p1);
//!
//! // Let us sign another payload. Each signatures requires new entropy, which is mixed into the
//! // the secret chain state using a keyed hash. This latest seed will be used to create a 3rd
//! // keypair, and the hash of its public key is included this block. The 2nd block is signed with
//! // the 2nd keypair created above.
//! let p2 = Payload::new(456, Hash::from_bytes([69; 32]));
//! let new_entropy = generate_secret().unwrap();
//! mychain.sign(&new_entropy, &p2);
//! assert_eq!(mychain.tail().payload, p2);
//!
//! // A chain is identified by its `chain_hash`, which is the hash of the 1st block in the chain:
//! let chain_hash = mychain.chain_hash();
//!
//! // We can now open that chain from the public chain store, which will fully validate the chain
//! // and set the tail at the latest block:
//! let chain = store.open_chain(&chain_hash).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(chain.tail().payload, p2);
//! ```
